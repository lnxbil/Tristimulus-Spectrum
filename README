This repository consists of the data (20nm slices) of
the tristimulus of the human eye (directory data) and
an application of this data to a angular resolution
problem of the Peterberger Halbmeter Telescope (PHT),
which can be found in 'pht-resolution'.

The data was extracted from the following blog post
and is widely available on the internet, but only in
graph/image form. If you want to do your own prints,
you need the data provided in this repository.
